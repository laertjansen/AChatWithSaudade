# A Chat With Saudade

A Chat With Saudade is a quiet, lyrical dialogue between a girl named Mia and an unseen presence that has shaped her life in ways sheâ€™s only beginning to understand.

As Mia confronts her memories, losses, and longing, she's drawn into a conversation that challenges how we perceive the past, the future, and everything we leave behind. 

Blurring the lines between presence and absence, A Chat With Saudade explores themes of nostalgia and acceptance.

Developed in Unreal Engine. Available in English and Portuguese.
